## Project Objective
The primary objective of this personal homepage project is to create a home page designed to showcase my personal information, skills, and portfolio, while providing a means for interaction. The project also allows me to get familiar with **Eslint** and **Prettier**. The website is **W3C Compliant** and shows the use of **HTML/CSS** and **JavaScript** together. 

## Features
1. Home Page (index.html) -> The user opens this page, which contains my very brief self-introduction, resume and contact information.
2. About Page (about.html) -> This page provides a detailed introduction to myself and showcases my skills, education, exprience so far. 
3. Projects Page (projects.html) -> This page shows the projects I have done before and some introduction to the projects.
